# Proxmox Virtual Machine Builder with Cloud Images
**NOTE:** This is forked from [https://github.com/francismunch/vmbuilder](https://github.com/francismunch/vmbuilder) excellent script, modified as required

<p>&nbsp;</p>
You can have a virtual machine created and booted with the information you set within two minutes. Auto downloads the cloud image if you need it and once all the information is set it auto starts it for you.

This script can be used for beginners that don't know much about Proxmox yet or it can be used by advanced users to get a bunch of different VM's running in no time.  (Pro tip give it your ansible key when asked for keys and then run your playbook after creation)



How To Run the script
  
   1) First download the script vmbuilder.sh from github onto your proxmox node
   2) Then you need to chmod +x vmbuilder.sh
   3) If using SSH keys know the file location
   4) Make sure you have snippets enabled on one of your storage options. In the Proxmox GUI go to Datacenter then Storage to see if you have it enabled or not
   5) Then ./vmbuilder.sh
   6) Then just follow the onscreen script questions and you will be up and running in no time!



Features
 If you are in a cluster environment you are able to pick the Proxmox node to have it on (by the way of qm migrate)
 It will download the image for you if you don't have it
 It builds a user.yaml file and adds it as a snippet - so you can customize a lot of the cloud image VM when creating it (See Proxmox Wiki about snippets to learn more)
 It checks what storage is availabe on your Proxmox node and you are able to pick what you want to use
 It checks what snippet storage is availabe on your Proxmox node and you are able to pick what you want to use
 You can customize:
   - Hostname
   - ID number (It checks ID's in the entire cluster and also provides next number if you don't use custom numbers)
   - Username
   - Password
   - Add a SSH key file (example id_rsa.pub)
   - Asks if you want to enable SSH password authentication (Keys are safer)
   - Select storage you want to run the Virtual Machine on
   - Select the storage location of your ISO files
   - Select the storage and location of your snippet files (for user.yaml)
   - Check if you want to use DHCP or enter Static IP
   - If you want to enter a VLAN number
   - If you want to resize the cloud image storage so you can have more space
   - It lets you set the number of cores and memory for the Virtual Machine
   - Asks if you want it to install qemu-guest-agent (see Proxmox's wiki for more infomation) - Great to have out of the box from the Admin side of Proxmox
   - Added the option to start after creation or not to start
   - Asks what Proxmox node to have the VM running after all is complete
   - Makes it simple to learn some of the CLI of proxmox (by reviewing the script) and some awesome built in featues of Proxmox to get things up and running fast and easily
